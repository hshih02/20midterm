            <h3 style="margin-top: 0;">What was the easiest part of this assignment?</h3>
            <p>
                    The easiest part of this assignment was to find an organization that would fit my interests and design a style
                    that would fit the demographicâ€™s taste. Because I am interested in contemporary art, it was easier for me to
                    design a website that would intrigue users who are in the same demographic.

            <h3>What was the most challenging part of this assignment?</h3>
            <p>
                    The most challenging part of this assignment was implementation. I had a clear idea of how my website wanted to
                    look, but setting specific details, such as margin, padding, alignment, and the order of elements, was hard to
                    accomplish.
